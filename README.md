## Description
<!--
Give a short description on what your project accomplishes and what tools is uses. Basically, what problems does it solve and why it's different from other apps in the app store.
-->
My project is built for users who want to get healthy. When I have been trying to lose weight and get stronger at the same time, itâ€™s been frustrating to have to use two separate apps. You'd need one app for working out, then have to use another app that provides features like entering meals and tracking nutrients. The idea for this app is to combine both of those into one single app to use seamlessly together and make your weight loss/fitness/muscle gaining journey much easier and less confusing. More importantly, it will help people understand how those two things can go hand in hand.
